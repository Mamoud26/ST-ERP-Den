# ST-ERP-Den

ERP-ToolBox is a MATLAB application for ST-ERPs denoising using non-conventional methods. It implements a generator of simulated data sets with an additive EEG activity as noise. The tool allows denoising of simulated and real data using different automatic adaptive filtering models and provides statistical analysis to ensure generality of the results. It could serve as a comparison tool for future studies dealing with ST-ERP denoising and be of broad use to the computational and cognitive neuroscience communities.

Prerequisites
---------------

ST-ERP-Denoising is implemented as a MATLAB Application, and has been tested on computers running Windows 7 and 10 (but should runs on macOS and Linux distributions) using MATLAB version from R2018b.

Installation
